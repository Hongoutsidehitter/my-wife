    <h1>1. Listen to Her</h1>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Sometimes, she just needs someone to listen, not fix things. Pay attention to what she says, remember the little details, and show that you care about her thoughts and feelings.</h4>
    <h1>2. Show Appreciation</h1>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Tell her what you love about herâ€”whether it's her kindness, her laugh, or how she supports you. A simple "I appreciate you" goes a long way.</h4>
    <h1>3. Spend Quality Time Together </h1>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Make time for her, even when you're busy. Plan dates, take walks, or just watch a movie together. The effort matters more than the activity itself.</h4>
